Notes:
======
* Default login (change ASAP after first login): 
    * Email: admin@example.com
    * Passw: admin
* AuthenticationModule and UserModule both works with User entity, 
  but AuthenticationModule works with unauthorized users,
  while UserModule is responsible for work with users' profiles.

TODO:
=====

Major:
    * Admin:Page: Add ajax save
    * Write tests
    * Improve default front functions (create archive and paginator for articles, add print style to default theme)
    * Add possibility to revert removal action to whole administration
    * Improve texts in menu designer form
    * Check security (http://php.vrana.cz/common-mistakes-in-securing-web-applications.php)
    * Port this item's content to github's issues?

Minor:
    * Add user the possibility to change his email (remember that email is used when hashing password)        
    * Create webalized name dynamically (using AJAX) on page creation form instead of hint "Empty fills itself"

Far future:
    * Add support for multiple languages
    * Add alternative menu designer with support for more "depth" (and probably without this jquery based tool)                
    
Ideas:
======
* Modules should load their own stylesheetâ€¦ (improve general module independance)
    * In base presenter when loading modules, try if file <module>/_layoutHeader.latte exists, if so, make array of them        
    * Then print/call this array in layout
