Notes:
======
* Default login (change ASAP after first login): 
    * Email: admin@example.com
    * Passw: admin
* AuthenticationPresenter and UserPresenter both works with User entity, 
  but Authentication works with unauthorized users,
  while UserPresenter is responsible for work with users' profiles.
* Modules are basically presenters with proper annotation

Known issues:
=============


TODO:
=====

Major:
    * Admin:Page: Add page previews
    * Write tests
    * Improve default front functions (create archive and paginator for articles, add print style to default theme)
    * Add possibility to revert removal action to whole administration
    * Improve texts in menu designer form
    * Check security (http://php.vrana.cz/common-mistakes-in-securing-web-applications.php)
Minor:
    * Add user the possibility to change his email (remember that email is used when hashing password)
    * Remove injecting of whole container (see app/Configurator.php) where possible. (Is it possible somewhere else than in authenticator?)
    * Rewrite Admin:Menu:menudesignerSubmit (use transactions probably)   
    * Create webalized name dynamically (using AJAX) on page creation form instead of hint "Empty fills itself"
    * Improve page creation form (some design cleanup)
    * Refactor Front\RouteManager

Far future:
    * Add support for multiple languages
    * Add alternative menu designer with support for more "depth" (and probably without this jquery based tool)                
    
Ideas:
======
* Modules should load their own stylesheet… (improve general module independance)
    * In base presenter when loading modules, try if file <module>/_layoutHeader.latte exists, if so, make array of them        
    * Then print/call this array in layout
